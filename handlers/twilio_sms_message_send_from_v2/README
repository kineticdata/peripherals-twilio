=== Detailed Description
This handler interacts with Twilio and sends a SMS text message to a phone
number of your choosing. This handler uses the twilio-ruby gem which needs the
Account SID and Auth Token (both can be found on the twilio account dashboard) 
to authenticate the sending of the message. The number that you are sending the
message to must be of the form "+[country code][phone number]" with no spaces. 
The message sent cannot be longer than 160 Characters and an error will be
raised if the attempted message is over that limit.
